			<br/>
			
			<p>
			Marcus Mosiah Garvey was born on August 17, 1887 in St.Ann's Bay,Jamaica. 
			He was a very chrasimatic Black leader who was renown for organizing
			black empowerment movements around the world. Most people readily recognize Marcus Garvey 
			for his formation of the UNIA (Universal Negro Improvement Association) an organization dedicated
			to racial pride, economic self-sufficiency, and the formation of an independent Black nation in Africa.
			He taught that Blacks would be respected only when they were economically strong, 
			and he preached an independent Black economy within the framework of white capitalism. 
			He brought encouragement and inspiration,to many black persons globally who saw him as a visionary and trailblazer.
			Garvey, despite his influence had many enemies including those amongst the black community
			and his influence declined rapidly when he and other UNIA members were 
			indicted for mail fraud in 1922 in connection with the sale of stock 
			for the Black Star Line.Marcus Garvey died June 10, 1940, in England in much obscurity; it was not until 1964, 
			that his body was returned to Jamaica. For his massive contributions to the Black community,
			he was recognized by Jamaica as their first national hero in 1969.
